# terencet.github.io Jekyll Site

## Installation

I assume you have already downloaded and installed Ruby. Here's what you need to do next:

1. Run `gem install jekyll bundler`
2. Copy the theme in your desired folder.
3. Enter into the folder by executing `cd name-of-the-folder`.
4. Run `bundle install`.
5. If you want to access and customize the theme, use `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This way it will be accessible on `http://localhost:4000`.
6. Upload the content of the compiled `_site` folder on your host server.
